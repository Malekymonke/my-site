    <p><b>Welcome to the Rustfiends archive.</b></p>
    <p>This section contains fragments, sketches, and internal documents from the world of Rustfiends — a setting where machines remember too much and people forget what they were built for.</p>
    <p>Everything here exists in the gray zone between fiction and documentation. Expect scattered logs, pseudo-technical notes, and glimpses of characters that may or may not be human. Think of it as a cabinet of digital ghosts.</p>
    <p>Updates will appear irregularly, like corrupted data surfacing for a moment before sinking again.</p>
