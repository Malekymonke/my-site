    <p>This page is for essays, reflections, and longer thoughts.  
    Here I’ll write things that don’t fit inside images — process notes, cultural commentary, and everything that explains why I make what I make.</p>

    <p>Unlike the artwork tab, this section is quieter, more like reading a personal log or an internal monologue.  
    It’s less about showing and more about <i>thinking aloud</i>.  
    Expect a mix of drafts, manifestos, half-finished essays, and philosophical nonsense.  
    This is where I let the text breathe.</p>
